# About

These task includes below API test:


-```CheckGetResponseWithValidID``` method validates the return values from response by comparing the expected values and also asserts expected response code

-```CheckErrorWithInvalidType``` method sends invalid type id as parameter and verifies the expected status code by comparing the response status code, and it also verifies the error response message

-```CheckErrorWithValidTypeInvalidID``` method sends invalid id(not existing) as parameter and verifies the expected status code by comparing the response status code.

-```CheckPostMethodResponseWithATestProduct``` fails, I used a fake link to show what would I do if there were a post method test

-Before Test class; I created an object with exact values for a product that I know will return in response
